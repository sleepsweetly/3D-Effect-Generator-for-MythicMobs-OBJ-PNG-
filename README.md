## ðŸŽ‰ AuraForge v1.0.X

**AuraForge** is a powerful visual tool designed for creating custom MythicMob particle effects â€” without any coding!



### ðŸ§© Features 

* **Layer System**
  Organize your effects into separate layers for more complex visual designs. Each layer works independently.

* **Per-Layer Settings**
  Customize every detail for each layer separately, including particle name, delay (tick), color, offset, and more.

* **PNG & OBJ Support**
  Import PNG images or 3D OBJ models and scale them to fit the drawing area for more precise effects.

* **2D Drawing + 3D Preview**
  As you draw in 2D, a real-time 3D view helps you understand how your effect will look in-game.

* **Proximity Mode**
  Sorts particles by distance to center, creating wave-like, expanding, or natural flowing animations.

* **Rotate Mode**
  Your drawn shape rotates over time â€” great for spiraling spells, spinning circles, and rotating effects.

* **Persistent Effects**
  Use `areaeffectcloud` to create long-lasting or area-based effects that stay in the scene.

* **Resizable Drawing Area**
  The canvas resizes dynamically, giving you full control and space to work in as much detail as you want.

* **Performance Mode**
  Generates optimized MythicMob code by reducing redundant lines for better in-game performance.

* **Layer Management**
  Move layers up or down, rename them, or reorder execution to match your desired effect sequence.

* **Save Project (.fxgen)**
  Store all your drawings, layers, and settings in a single `.fxgen` file you can reopen later.

* **YAML Code Export**
  Instantly convert your effect into MythicMob-compatible YAML format with a single click.

* **Multiple Generation Modes**
  Choose between sequential, proximity-based, rotating, or custom modes for flexible animation logic.

* **User-Friendly Interface**
  Designed for both beginners and experienced users, with an intuitive layout and easy controls.
